Aegean is a period as well as a region around the Aegean Sea.  Aegean civilization known through epic poems by Homer: The Illiad and the Odyssey.  

Cycladic art (from the inhabitants of the Cycladic islands) was of simplified female shapes with wedge and columnar shapes.

Minoan art richest in the Aegean world.  Palaces built (and destroyed by earthquakes), some so large that they survived in Greek legends as the Labrinth of the Minotaur.  Marine life a favorite subject, e.g. dolphins in the Queens Megaron (c 1700-1300 B.C).
