The Basilica of Constantine was constructed in the early fourth century A.D. and was the largest roofed interior in all of Rome.  It's shape is derived from the main hall of public baths built by earlier emperors.

The upper walls of the centre tract or nave contained large windows (a clerestory) which provided light to the interior.
