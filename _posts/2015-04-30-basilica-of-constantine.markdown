The Colosseum was built in Rome and completed in A.D 80.  The Colosseum is an amphitheater used for gladiatorial games and could house 50,000 spectators.  The interior structure was very well designed to handle the large number of spectators, moving in and out of the building.  The Colosseum is constructed from concrete with exterior stonework.  Columns on the outside were in Doric style (at ground level), Ionic style (intermediate level) and Corinthian style at upper level.  The column styles reflect the lightening of the structure from ground level upwards.

The Pantheon, also in Rome, was completed in the early 2nd century A.D.  The Pantheon is one of the most impressive surviving Roman structures.  At the time, the size and weight of the dome was unprecedented.  The Pantheon design is a dome on top of a cylinder, with the interior height equal to the diameter of the dome.  At the top is an opening, the oculus, through which light enters.  The Pantheon was dedicated to the seven planetary gods.
