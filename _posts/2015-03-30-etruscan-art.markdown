Etruscans lived in the area in modern Italy between Florence and Rome in the period from 700 B.C. onwards.  Uncertainty whether they were indigenous or came from Asia Minor.

Etruscans used Greek alphabet but had a different language.  At their peak they had an empire from Naples to the Po valley in the north.  However, the empire was a federation of city-states.

Etruscans art was distinctive - for example sculpture was more dynamic than Greek.  Painting was lively and showed a different view of the afterlife.
