The **Romans** left a vast literary legacy that provides details of their history.

What is Roman art?  In the fine arts Roman style was often based on earlier Greek art.  There is not a single unifying style, instead Roman art is based on absorbed styles from other nations and regions.

Roman architecture was very creative, on a massive scale and developed rapidly to meet the needs of the growing empire.

Two distinctive aspects to the Roman architecture were the use of concrete and various types of arch.  Neither were entirely new techniques, but they were first used widely by the Romans.

The earliest extant example of the typical massive size and boldness characteristic of Roman architecture is the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia in Palestrina.  This was constructed in the early 1st century BC.  The sanctuary is distinctive in how it has been designed to fit into the landscape.

Types of arch construction used by the Romans includes barrel vaults (half cylinders), groin vaults (two barrels intersecting at right angles) and domes.  True arches are built from voussoirs (wedge-shaped blocks).
