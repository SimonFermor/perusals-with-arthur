Sumerians came to Mesopotamia around 4000 B.C.  Each Sumerian city-state had itâ€™s own local god.  Houses were clustered around a sacred area, at the center of which was a platform temple, a ziggurat.  The most famous ziggurat was the Tower of Babel.

Votive statues had large eyes to communicate the sense of awe of the terrifying deities they worshiped.  Votive bodies are rigorously simplified and schematic.  Arms and legs are like rounded pipes.

Persians occupied Babylon in 539 B.C. and produced art and architecture that was a synthesis of other styles, including both Assyrian and Greek.
