...Chabad, which is based in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is unique among Hasidic sects for its emphasis on the recruitment of non-Orthodox Jews, and Matisyahu, who goes by a single name, has come to be a sort of unofficial ambassador... [New York Times, December 23, 2007]

Quote 2:
--------
The French experiment in Socialism has thus come a long way from its Keynesian beginnings in 1981. The Socialists then wanted the French people to spend the country to prosperity, so they put more money in the hands of the less well off. They saw this as meeting the demands of social justice as well as the needs of the economy.

The difficulty was that France was all alone in stimulating its economy through inflationary spending - most other Western nations were still trying to hold down inflation - and much of the new French money in circulation was spent on imports, creating a wide foreign trade deficit.

So the Socialists backed away and began to pursue far more orthodox policies. The shift began last year, and it went further last week.... [New York Times, March 29, 1983]
