"You can think of nonlinear dynamics as a little equation animal that feeds on itself," he said on a recent visit to New York. "It's basically recursion. You start with a problem that spits out an answer. You feed the answer back into the problem and get another answer, which you put right back into the problem." [New York Times October, 19, 2004]
